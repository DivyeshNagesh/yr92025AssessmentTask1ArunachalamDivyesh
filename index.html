            <h2>What is a computer network?</h2>
            <p>
                A computer network is a system that connects multiple devices mainly for communication and sharing 
                resources. These networks can be through advanced wireless technology such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi or wired connections 
                through physical cables. They range from small Wi-Fi setups to large scale networks such as the
                internet.

            <h2>What is a social network and how does it work?</h2>
        <p>
            A social network is a platform or a website that allows users and organisations to communicate, collaborate and
            share information with each other. In most of these platforms users can create profiles, friend, follow and message other people.
            Some examples of social networks are Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat.

            <!--APRANET was one of the earliest computer network that was developed in in the late 1960's which is now a 
                appreciatable project as it plays an important role for today's technological interconnected world. another key
                factor that adjusts with network performance is bandwith, which essentially changes the speed of transmission
                of data, measured in bits per second (one of a digital information unit). This isn't the only type of digital
                information unit, there are also bits, bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes and petabytes. The difference
                between these units is the number of bits or bytes they contain. For example, 1 byte = 8 bits, 1 kilobyte = 1024 bytes,
                1 megabyte = 1024 kilobytes, 1 gigabyte = 1024 megabytes, 1 terabyte = 1024 gigabytes and 1 petabyte = 1024 terabytes.
                The technological era has changed massively rising to points like the Internet of Things (IoT) which is a system of
                interrelated physical devices, vehicles, buildings, and other objects that are embedded with sensors, software, and
                network connectivity that enables these objects to collect and exchange data. As well as the Internet of Me which
                refers to the idea of a personalised digital experience that is tailored to every
                people's needs or preferences. Moreover, information or data can be saved and even be accessed from anywhere in the world
                using cloud computing. Cloud computing a developed technology that allows individuals to save and access data and information
                over the internet rather than depending on a local storage. It provides easy access to a whole bunch of computing
                resources. Overall, computer networks are a vital role in our daily modern technology. They enable us to 
                communicate, share information, and access resources from anywhere in the world. This not only shapes
                us in our house but also in our work, bussiness, education, and even in our social life.-->
