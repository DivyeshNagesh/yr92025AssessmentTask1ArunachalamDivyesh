            <p>
                A computer network is a system that connects multiple devices mainly for communication and sharing 
                resources. These networks can be through advanced wireless technology such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi or wired connections 
                through physical cables. They range from small Wi-Fi setups to large scale networks such as the
                internet.

            <h2>What is a social network and how does it work?</h2>
        <p>
            A social network is a platform that connects users to build upon relationships, communication skills, and
            general interactions or experiences. These platforms enable the users to create profiles, and showcase 
            information. Through features like friending, following, and messaging, users can connect and eventually
            create a community or a group based on their interests, hobbies, goals, and values too. An essential
            part of social networks are entities where it represents a person, group, or organisation. For example,
            a person who is using Facebook is an example of an entity, as they can interact, connect, and communicate
            with other users. Six degree of Separation is a vital concept related to social network, highlighting
            how people are connected to no more than six other users in their relationships in a social network. 

            Digital footprints and digital citisenship are also important concepts in social networks. Digital footprint
            refers to an individuals left data on the internet, such as social media posts, comments, likes, dislikes, shares, and 
            browsing history. On the other hand, digital citizenship acts upon responsible use of technology and keeping safe in the internet.
            It encapsulates the rights and responsibilities of users in the technological world, including privacy and
            security. This not only helps them to be safe but also for other users and feel as if they are getting respected.

            Social networks are not only vital for relationships and interactions but for also shaping a good community.
            Social networks whether it be face-to-face or virtually they both play a key role in our daily lives empowering
            connections, communication, and collaboration.

            <!--APRANET was one of the earliest computer network that was developed in in the late 1960's which is now a 
                appreciatable project as it plays an important role for today's technological interconnected world. another key
                factor that adjusts with network performance is bandwith, which essentially changes the speed of transmission
                of data, measured in bits per second (one of a digital information unit). This isn't the only type of digital
                information unit, there are also bits, bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes and petabytes. The difference
                between these units is the number of bits or bytes they contain. For example, 1 byte = 8 bits, 1 kilobyte = 1024 bytes,
                1 megabyte = 1024 kilobytes, 1 gigabyte = 1024 megabytes, 1 terabyte = 1024 gigabytes and 1 petabyte = 1024 terabytes.
                The technological era has changed massively rising to points like the Internet of Things (IoT) which is a system of
                interrelated physical devices, vehicles, buildings, and other objects that are embedded with sensors, software, and
                network connectivity that enables these objects to collect and exchange data. As well as the Internet of Me which
                refers to the idea of a personalised digital experience that is tailored to every
                people's needs or preferences. Moreover, information or data can be saved and even be accessed from anywhere in the world
                using cloud computing. Cloud computing a developed technology that allows individuals to save and access data and information
                over the internet rather than depending on a local storage. It provides easy access to a whole bunch of computing
                resources. Overall, computer networks are a vital role in our daily modern technology. They enable us to 
                communicate, share information, and access resources from anywhere in the world. This not only shapes
                us in our house but also in our work, bussiness, education, and even in our social life.-->
