        <h2>What is hardware?</h2>
        <p>
            Physical components of a electronic device is called hardware, essentially builds up the "backbone" of the device. The complementary
            of hardware is software which is things related to the inside of the laptop which you cannot physically touch or see. A node in each
            device is an important role in the network, whereas smart hubs or hubs contain and share data to many different devices.
            <br><br>
            Routers manages internet connection between different electionic devices within a certain range or a specific network. Wireless
            Access Points (WAPs) are wired connnections which provide connectivity between wireless devices. Servers handle specific tasks
            such as storing data, hosting websites, or even managing emails, with types which include file servers, web servers and database
            servers. Overall, all these components binded together enhance the interconnectivity of different individuals but also making it
            functional for the individuals' needs.
